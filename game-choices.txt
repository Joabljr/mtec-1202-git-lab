Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic, simple two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. 
The objective is to get three of your symbols in a row—horizontally, vertically, 
or diagonally—before your opponent does. 
One player uses X and the other uses O, taking turns placing their symbols in empty squares.

I want to build those games because of their simplicity, how popular the game is, 
and because it could bring a lot of fun in a short amount of time.

The interaction is the Xs/Os and deciding which box to insert them into

The winning condition is getting 3 of your shapes in a row before the other player does
